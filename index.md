## mycHelium blockRing

### the knowledge network for humanity (mycelium with an H)

The mychelium is to humans what the mycelium is to trees :)

We are the people empowering the Human blockRing,
we have developped a blockchain technology that is robust
and don't rely on a proof of work to solve the Byzantine Problem.



our blockchain is composed of 

 * **Merkle DAG** of cryptographycally linked data ([IPLD][1])
 * **KYC SSI** a secure sovereign identity and authentification provider for access control ([ydentity][2])
 * **Replication Data Model** and indempotent merge of blockchains ([CxRDT][3])
